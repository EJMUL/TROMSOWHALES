Sharing code for whale related stuff (public repository)

Please feel free to share any code that might be usefull for others in the group. keep in mind that the repository is open to outside people as well, because I have to pay a monthly fee for a closed repository...

Click on a file/script to read (copy to r), comment on, or alter the script.
After changing the code select if you want to change the master or start a new branch. By using branches, others can look at (and work with) previous versions. If you want to totally change a script, perhaps it is better to add a new file/script.
